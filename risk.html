    <h2>Risks & Complications</h2>

    <div class="terms-container">
        <li><b>Allergic Reactions</b></li>
        <a>Some people have allergic reactions to blood received during a transfusion, even when given the right blood type. In these cases symptoms include hives and itching. Like most allergic reactions, this can be treated with antihistamines. However, a doctor should be consulted if the reaction becomes serious.</a>
        <li><b>Fever</b></li>
        <a>Developing a fever after a transfusion is not serious. A fever is your body’s response to the white blood cells in the transfused blood. However, it can be a sign of a serious reaction if the patient is also experiencing nausea or chest pain. Patients should consult their doctors if other symptoms or side effects are present.</a>
        <li><b>Acute Immune Hemolytic Reaction</b></li>
        <a>An acute immune hemolytic reaction is a very serious, but rare, reaction caused by a patient’s body attacking the transfused red blood cells. The attack triggers a release of a substance that damages the kidneys. This is often the case when the donor blood is not a proper match with the patient’s blood type. Symptoms include nausea, fever, chills, chest and lower back pain, and dark urine.</a>
        <li><b>Blood-borne Infections</b></li>
        <a>All donated blood is screened and tested for potential viruses, bacteria, and parasites. However, occasionally these agents can still infect a patient after a transfusion.</a>
        <a>The risk of catching a virus or any other blood-borne infection from a blood transfusion is very low.</a>
        <li><a>HIV. All donated blood is thoroughly tested for HIV. There is a 1 in 2 million chance that donated blood will not only carry HIV but also infect a transfusion recipient.</a></li>
        <li><a>Hepatitis B and C. The odds of catching hepatitis B from donated blood is about 1 in 300,000. The risk with hepatitis C is 1 in 1.5 million.</a></li>
        <li><a>West Nile Virus. The risk of catching West Nile Virus from a blood transfusion is approximately 1 in 350,000.</a></li>
        <p><b>Blood Transfusions</b>
            Often patients who have received a blood transfusion experience no complications or problems. However, minor to severe problems do occasionally occur.
            
            Some of the most common complications in blood transfusions are listed below.</p>
